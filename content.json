[{"title":"motion analysis of CCC","date":"2017-03-07T07:50:05.000Z","path":"2017/03/07/motion-analysis-of-CCC/","text":"Motions of 2016 CCDC THBT all of China’s non-top university should only teach STEM courses (Science, Technology, Engineering and mathematics) ( I didn’t realize the key point “China” until the debate finished. ~wu~wu~)①According to feedback, we failed to answer the question that what’s the difference between top U &amp; non-top U and this makes the opp side keep attacking us that it will definitely cause inequality that those who want to study humanity subjects need to pay more effort than those who want to study STEM.Solution: I just come up with an idea to rebut about the equality or fairness problem. I suddenly find out that it our policy doesn’t violate the fair principle because that fairness means that if people want to get the same interest, they need to pay the same cost regardless of their background or something else. But in the case, people want to learn STEM and people want to learn humanity have different goals and are chasing for different interests. To give an example, when the private schools increase their prices, is it unfair for those intend to study in private schools? The truth is that they are enjoying different services, and it is fair enough for them to pay different costs. The only differences is that the different cost now expands. And that’s we want to do, by expanding the cost difference, to encourage more students to study STEM and make more contribution to our country. ②The opp side put forward an argument that an important mission of U is to teach students think about some ultimate question, who am I, where are we from, What is the meaning of life and so on, helping them develop fully instead of focus on some practical courses. And they think only humanity courses help students think about those question. Actually, I did react to this argument and rebut that to achieve full-development is not so to do with the courses the U set. Students are supposed to participate in more social activities or associations for the reason that it is those extracurricular activities help a student develop more fully instead of the courses set by U. From the judge’s perspective, my rebuttal only answers the second level of the question. And after the feedback, I was considering that what was the meaning of second level. Also, it was my first time to hear a judge analyzing an argument from different levels.Self-reflection: Now I get it that the second level means that my rebuttal only explain how the U helps students achieve integrated development. But the first level is that whether U should teach students to think about those ultimate questions. Normally, when we want to do some things, the correct logic is: what is the “thing” -&gt; why we should do it -&gt; how to do it. So to give a more convincing rebuttal, I’d better admit that teaching students to think about those question is beneficial. But the fact is that not only those humanity courses help people to think about it but those STEM courses also help a lot. Physics helps us to figure out the question where are we from, astronomy makes us realize how tiny are we in the universe and makes us try to think about the status and role of human in the universe. Biology helps us know about the subtlety of creature and life, making us treasure our life. (But I still think it is not convincing enough because all subjects have their own unique function, meaning and significance which are irreplaceable).③One of my argument is that the major contradiction we are facing is that the productive force is inconsistent with the productive relation. And the fact is that STEM courses favor improving our productive force a lot while those humanity subjects help adjust the productive relation. But I think I failed to prove that after we do that, our economy will develop enough and the major contradiction existing will be solved and finally achieve communism. That is our ultimate goal and at that time, people will not be bound from labor, making it possible to learn or do whatever they want or interested in.So the policy is for a long-term consideration. So it seems that the judge didn’t buy my point. Another reason that the judge didn’t agree this point is that in our country, we also need a lot of lawyers who are considered people adjusting productive relation. And I failed to react to this. Now I am considering that, maybe I can explain that a considerable number of lawyers are dealing with some social problems which are exactly caused by the poor economy. So increasing the number of lawyers is just a palliative. And our policy is the cure. ④ One argument raised up by my partner is that students majored in STEM have great advantage on jog hunting. So our policy helps students adapt to the market and meet the current need of market which is not only beneficial to individual but also the whole society. Anyway, the opp side point out that our policy will only worsen the situation because if all students go to study STEM, it will just cause an occupation jam because the number of graduate increase a lot while the need of market remains which do harm to the graduates. And I didn’t do a good job to protect it. I explain that the gov will have many other corresponding policies, such as encourage industry and scientific research to employ those graduates. But it seemed not so convincing. Motion 2. THW abolish all patent.It was not only our first time to rank 1st but rank 1st as the lower house. From the judge’s feedback, he thought that we raised up a very important point about the time gap which means there is a time gap from an innovation appearing to it is copied. The time gap actually helps protect the innovator’s interest. The judge thought this point push the whole debate to a new angle.But looking back at the debate, I think my argumentation can be promoted a lot.①My partner raised up a new argument that knowledge is the property of the whole human and patent, as a kind of useful and beneficial knowledge even deserve more spreading. But the existence of patent actually hampers its spreading. Actually the upper house has already presented a similar opinion that it stops further innovation because anyone else want to promote it need to pay for the patent. So the best way for us to improve the argument is to consider this problem from the original innovator’s perspective. So I pointed out that patent not only do harm to other innovators but the original innovator himself. First, patent helps the innovator grasp the unique use of the innovation and make him make profit from if continuously which will reduce innovator’s incentive to improve or renovate his innovation. Because laziness is the nature of human being, since I can keep gaining profit from it, why do I bother myself to renovate it? So the existence of patent brings an illusion to the innovator that he can forever enjoy the profit. But the market is fierce, when he is content with the status quo, others are still trying to invent something more advanced to seize the market and once they succeed, those original innovators’ dreams break. Anyway it’s too late to react when their products are already replaced in the market. So from a long term consideration, patent does not protect the innovator’s interest. Second, I pointed out that patent is not the best way to protect innovator’s interest. There are many cases that some company copy others’ patent and with better marketing strategy, they successfully seize the market and gain great profit from it. But their illegal cost which pay to the innovator is part of their interest. So combined with the time gap theory, we put forward a new solution that those innovators need to make full use of the time gap and cooperate with industrial field and seize the market in advance. Also, without the protection of patent, if they want to maintain their market shares, they need to keep doing further renovation to improve the competiveness of their products, eg higher quality, lower cost, more efficient productive way and so on. And these two aspect actually give rebuttal to the opp side who brings up that patent give more motivation and finance to the innovators. (I did a somehow dangerous thing that, in my argumentation, to prove the importance of further renovation I mentioned that the quality of innovation counts but not the number of innovation. ) ②Based on the principle of free market, we need to point out that patent actually help the development of monopoly. The potential harm to the monopoly has been proved above. Then we need to show the tangible harm to the consumers, to the whole society. In a free market, fierce competition pushes all the producers keep improving their products, resulting in higher quality, lower cost of products. Bring material benefit to the consumers. To sum up, if we successfully prove our policy bring benefit to innovator, consumer and result in more high-quality innovation in the whole society, we can win the debate.Motion 3 : THW grant elites two votes. Though you won the debate, but it was just because you had participated in the workshop.——AngelicaKwan I need to admit that we did give some arguments based on the three essential components of democracy. But we still do not answer the problem why democracy is so important or make it more specific why one person one vote is so important. It is a very difficult question. I tried to search some articles and did not find a satisfied answer. But during my thinking, I found out a problem that most of the gov’s arguments were just discussing about narrow voting ——vote for making decision. So they say that how wise the elites are, how much information they know, ect. And the fact is that in most of countries, decisions are actually made by elites. The only difference is that whether their power of making decision is empowered by people(public?). But I think “vote” in this motion should be a generalized one that voting is a basic right of a citizen who uses it to chase and protect his own interest, put it another way, it is about how to distribute social resources. So even though elites have more access to information and more well-educated, they are just making decision to protect their own interest. When their interest is consistent with normal people, it is reasonable for them to have one more vote. But the fact is that there are so many interest clashes between elites and normal people. So after figuring out the meaning of voting, I think that the motion is not so debatable because giving someone one more vote means we are giving him more right to chase his interest but it doesn’t make sense because we would only give more right to vulnerable group, affirmative action eg, instead of advantage groups who have already enjoyed more social resources. In a conclusion, if we can prove that the motivation of elites to vote is to chase their own interest and there will be interest clashes between elites and normal people and elites actually have already enjoyed more resources than normal people have, the debate would be easier for us. And during my search, I found a relatively reasonable reason to explain the legitimacy of one person one vote. One of the functions of modern democracy is to guarantee equality and one person one vote is a form of political equality. When we build up our country, we stipulate some rights and obligation. We are living under the same legal system which means we are fulfilling the same obligation, so we deserve the same right, right of voting surely included. Motion 4: THW ban the extraction and consumption of all fossil fuel.(oel,gas,coal,etc) Personally, I don’t think this motion is fair for the gov side. Anyway what I learn from this debate is the cooperation between me and my partner. Because one of the most important arguments that to avoid those harm caused by fossil fuel is not ban using it but use it correctly. But from the feedback of Doris, this appeared in the 6min of my speech. Since it is a very important part of our case, we’d better raise it up as early as possible. Actually, I did remind my partner to put forward our case at the beginning of his speech but it seemed that he forgot to do so. And I was not so focusing on his speech so I didn’t put it forward at the very beginning of my speech either. So it is a problem of our strategy.In this debate, I didn’t do a good job in time distribution. Because I didn’t elaborate enough to prove that even for a long-term consideration, banning the extraction and consumption of fossil fuel would not be a good choice. Because all the arguments raised by the gov side is for a long-term consideration, health, sustainability, environment or anything else. So my job should prove to the judge that our case is better that the policy of gov side even for a long-term consideration. So the gov side mentioned that we relied too much on fossil fuel but it is unrenewable and once they are run out it will be a disaster. To react to this, we need to point out that the status quo is that we have already realized the problem and we are making efforts to change the situation. But to achieve this transition, we need finance and technology support. Then we need to show that how fossil fuel influence our economy development that once we stop its extraction and consumption our economy will just collapse. As a result, we can not even survive. Let alone putting money and other resources into achieving the transition. Because without finance and technology support, all of their promise to achieve transition is just a beautiful lie which would not happen. So our case is that first we need to supervise the use of fossil fuel to avoid misuse and at the same time with the development of our economy we will give more support to the cleaner energy. And finally make our energy structure cleaner and more sustainable.Anyway, except the problem of our cooperation, I think that we still did some good job. For example, I listed some data to show what role is fossil fuel playing in our society, 80% of electricity used in China is produced from burning coal and every year America imports 1/4 of total oil production in the world. And I tried to visualize the outcome of the policy from the angles of country, company, people’s daily life. So I mark down some data in case next time I meet some realative motions. With current consumption rate, our use of fossil fuel can last forPetroleum: 45-50 years.Natural gas: 50-60 yearsCoal: 200-220 years. Our(the whole world) energy structure currently:Oil: 36%Gas: 23%Coal: 26%Nuclear,solar,wind,hydrod 9%Wood,others 6% 20 richest countries comsume:50% of coal80% of natural gas65% of oil Fossil fuel produces greehhouse gas:3/4 sulfur dioxide1/3 nitrogen dioxide1/2 carbon dioxide Motion 5: THR public figure openly recognize and propaganda herself as feminist (e.g.Hillary Clinton,TaylorSwift,Victoria Secrets’angels)In this debate, we all admit the feminism is beneficial and something good. So the only clash comes to whether public figure recognizing and propaganda as feminist helps more people know about and understand feminism and finally achieve equality between male and female.Though we succeeded in proving to the judge that how this works to achieve feminism. However, I think we forget an important part that we should emphasize why public figure is an important and even unique way to propaganda feminism. So we could state out the status quo that most of the women don’t have the interest to or access to read those professional books introducing feminism. But with the high exposure rate of public figure, it is easier for women to know about feminism. At least it is the most convenient and feasible way to propaganda feminism currently. So before we achieve equality between male and female, there is no reason to stop public figures from recognizing and propaganda themselves as feminists. Motion 6: TH would not accuse Felix of murder. Though I didn’t participate in this debate, I have some opinions. Actually I think there is a very important point that though Felix has lost his memory, whether he would admit his criminal act when he sees the evidence. If he believe what he did, we would accuse him of course. So I think that the motion should be debated based on the premise that Felix didn’t admit his act. For gov side:①We can focus on the rehabilitation of CJS that if Felix doesn’t remember he had committed a murder, punish him would not rehabilitate him but just cause hatred to the government on him.②If Felix doesn’t believe what he had done but we still insist accusing him, from Felix’s perspective, it is just like he is wronged(冤枉) and even framed(陷害). And if the government can do this to him, why the government can not do so to others? Would it develop into a tool of tyranny? This point is somehow weird, but there are so few arguments for gov side. For opp side:①Punishment aims at illegal behavior. Unfortunately, behavior would not disappear because of the loss of memory and every behavior has its own executor which means if we want to punish this criminal act we can only punish Felix.②If we don’t accuse Felix, it provides a possibility for others to avoid punishment. Assume that if one day there is a kind of drug which can remove someone’s memory, how should we deal with those criminal deliberately commit some crimes and then take the drugs. Also, it will increase the cost of law enforcement because if every criminal claims that he has lost his memory we could just examine them one by one before accuse them. Correspondingly, the increase of cost law enforcement means the decrease of cost of crime. So to a certain extent, goc’s case indirectly encourages crime.③Respond to the gov’s case that Felix without memory should not be punished. We need to point out that his act is not a random case, his behavior roots from his mode of thinking and his reaction to the outside irritation which would not disappear with his loss of memory. It means if next time he comes across a similar situation, he is likely to do the same thing.So that is our purpose to rehabilitate him. We didn’t do a good job in elaboration in this debate. As a debate of IR, I think the main clash is whether regional cooperation is beneficial for the development of ASEAN countries. We only gave many titles that cooperation can build a free market, reduce customs, etc. But we didn’t explain how these can promote the development. Maybe we can elaborate it with the below aspects. A free market helps every production factor flows freely in the ASEAN countries. Then with the regulating effect of the market, those production factors will flow to the place where the productive efficiency is highest thus optimize the sources distribution in ASEAN countries. The economic cooperation increases the industry scale which add their chips when negotiating with other countries. With the economic relation, ASEAN countries will be tied together. It means once a county of them suffer from economic impact, others will also be damaged from it. So ASEAN countries will help each other to deal with outside impact. Since the economy of ASEAN increase because of union, with the bigger economy, their ability to tackle outside impact also increases.4.Since they are tied together, they would also try to reduce inner conflict in order to achieve benefit maximization. Besides the economic cooperation, it seems that we can also put forward the military cooperation. How ASEAN unite together to fight against the threaten of bully(China?). Motion 8: THBT Disney should make a princess with many lovers instead of one true love. The whole debate is so chaotic. It is so difficult to write the self-reflection. So let’s just skip it!","content":"<p>Motions of 2016 CCDC</p>\n<ol>\n<li>THBT all of China’s non-top university should only teach STEM courses (Science, Technology, Engineering and mathematics)<a id=\"more\"></a>\n( I didn’t realize the key point “China” until the debate finished. ~wu~wu~)<br>①According to feedback, we failed to answer the question that what’s the difference between top U &amp; non-top U and this makes the opp side keep attacking us that it will definitely cause inequality that those who want to study humanity subjects need to pay more effort than those who want to study STEM.<br>Solution: I just come up with an idea to rebut about the equality or fairness problem.

This point is somehow weird, but there are so few arguments for gov side.</p>\n<p>For opp side:<br>①Punishment aims at illegal behavior. Unfortunately, behavior would not disappear because of the loss of memory and every behavior has its own executor which means if we want to punish this criminal act we can only punish Felix.<br>②If we don’t accuse Felix, it provides a possibility for others to avoid punishment. Assume that if one day there is a kind of drug which can remove someone’s memory, how should we deal with those criminal deliberately commit some crimes and then take the drugs. Also, it will increase the cost of law enforcement because if every criminal claims that he has lost his memory we could just examine them one by one before accuse them. Correspondingly, the increase of cost law enforcement means the decrease of cost of crime. So to a certain extent, goc’s case indirectly encourages crime.<br>③Respond to the gov’s case that Felix without memory should not be punished. We need to point out that his act is not a random case, his behavior roots from his mode of thinking and his reaction to the outside irritation which would not disappear with his loss of memory. It means if next time he comes across a similar situation, he is likely to do the same thing.<br>So that is our purpose to rehabilitate him. </p>\n<p>We didn’t do a good job in elaboration in this debate. As a debate of IR, I think the main clash is whether regional cooperation is beneficial for the development of ASEAN countries. We only gave many titles that cooperation can build a free market, reduce customs, etc. But we didn’t explain how these can promote the development. Maybe we can elaborate it with the below aspects.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A free market helps every production factor flows freely in the ASEAN countries. Then with the regulating effect of the market, those production factors will flow to the place where the productive efficiency is highest thus optimize the sources distribution in ASEAN countries. </li>\n<li>The economic cooperation increases the industry scale which add their chips when negotiating with other countries.</li>\n<li>With the economic relation, ASEAN countries will be tied together. It means once a county of them suffer from economic impact, others will also be damaged from it. So ASEAN countries will help each other to deal with outside impact. Since the economy of ASEAN increase because of union, with the bigger economy, their ability to tackle outside impact also increases.<br>4.Since they are tied together, they would also try to reduce inner conflict in order to achieve benefit maximization. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Besides the economic cooperation, it seems that we can also put forward the military cooperation. How ASEAN unite together to fight against the threaten of bully(China?).</p>\n<p>Motion 8: THBT Disney should make a princess with many lovers instead of one true love.</p>\n<p>The whole debate is so chaotic. It is so difficult to write the self-reflection. So let’s just skip it!</p>\n","tags":[{"name":"debate","slug":"debate","permalink":"https://github.com/simonisacoder/Simon-s-house.git/Simon-s-house/tags/debate/"}]},{"title":"markdown learning","date":"2017-03-06T10:53:29.000Z","path":"2017/03/06/markdown-learning/","text":"markdown初养成 引用就是文本前面加 “&gt;
